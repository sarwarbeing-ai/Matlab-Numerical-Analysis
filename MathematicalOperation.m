% part a))
a=25/5*3 % mathematically it is (25/5)*3=15 basically Matlab follows BODMAS rule
b=4+2^3 % this is 12
c=(4+1)^2 % 25
d=2\12+5 % this is equivalent to 12/2+5=6+5=11
e=4-1*5 % this 4-5=-1

% part b))
x=sqrt(20*24/7-12^4)+exp(1.32) % sqrt and exp are the square root and exponential commands resp.


%p part c))
A=[1,2;3,4] %; this is will create a new line so A will be a matrix of order 2*2
B=[5,6;7,8]

% calculate matrix addition
addition=A+B

% calculate subtraction
subtraction=A-B

% perform matrix multiplication
multiplication=A*B
